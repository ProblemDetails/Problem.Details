# Release instructions
### 1. Run Semantic Release (updates release in GitHub)
```bash

```
### 2. NuGet Package
Take the version from the package.json (generated by semantic-release).
```bash
dotnet build -c Release -p:PackageVersion=1.1.0 src/Problem.Details
```
### 3. Upload NuGet package (manual process for now)
upload both `.nupkg`, `.snupkg`
